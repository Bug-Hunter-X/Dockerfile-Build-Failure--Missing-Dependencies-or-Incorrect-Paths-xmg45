This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: failure to build due to missing dependencies or incorrect file paths. The original `Dockerfile` contains the error, while `Dockerfile.fixed` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from improper handling of dependencies and the location of the application code within the Docker image. The solution addresses this by ensuring all necessary dependencies are installed and the application files are correctly copied into the image.
